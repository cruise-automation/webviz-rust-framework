# 🐢⚡ Wrflib

Wrflib is a fast, cross-platform (web+native), GPU-based application framework, written in Rust.

This is early stage and experimental. For now, see the [repository](https://github.com/cruise-automation/webviz-rust-framework) for usage details. We will add better documentation over time.
