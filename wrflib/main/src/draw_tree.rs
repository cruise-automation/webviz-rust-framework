//! The main primitives for rendering to the screen.
//!
//! A draw tree has two kinds of nodes: [`View`] and [`DrawCall`]. It might look like this:
//! * `View` - root
//!   * `DrawCall` - rendering some text
//!   * `DrawCall` - rendering some buttons
//!   * `View` - scrollable container
//!     * `DrawCall` - rendering some more buttons
//!     * `DrawCall` - rendering some more text
//!   * `DrawCall` - maybe even more buttons
//!
//! [`DrawCall`]s contain the actual data that needs to be drawn to the screen.
//!
//! [`View`]s are groups of draw calls, have some special features, such as
//! scrolling/clipping.
//!
//! Note that one level higher, we have a hierarchy of [`Pass`]es.
