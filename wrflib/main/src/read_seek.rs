/// behavior sucks: it causes clearing its internal buffer. Instead you have
/// to use [`BufReader::seek_relative`], but that breaks this nice transparent abstraction,
/// so maybe we should make our own [`BufReader`] variant that doesn't clear
/// on seek, and can be transparently passed into anything that accepts
/// [`ReadSeek`].
