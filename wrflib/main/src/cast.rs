//! Functions for (semi-)safely casting various things to each other.
//!
//! We mostly use this for slices of geometry and instance data, since you want
//! to be able to write simple Rust `struct`s to manage your shader data, which
//! we then read out as [`f32`] slices.
//!
//! TODO(JP): This is semi-safe, since we currently don't enforce that the
//! structs that get passed in indeed only contain f32 data. We might want to
//! add a derive-macro that throws an error if it's not valid data, and tags it
//! with a trait if it is valid.
//!
//! TODO(JP): We currently cannot safely cast [`Vec`]s of data, only slices. The
//! reason for this is that when the new, casted [`Vec`] gets dropped, then
//! [`std::alloc::GlobalAlloc::dealloc`] function will get called with a different
//! [`std::alloc::Layout`], which can cause memory corruption. We might want to
//! consider writing our own allocator that doesn't care about different layouts.
//! This is maybe a bit crazy, but might enable simpler code in a bunch of places!
//!
