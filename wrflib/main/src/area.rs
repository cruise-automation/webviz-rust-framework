use crate::*;

/// An [`Area`] can be thought of as a "pointer" into the draw tree. You typically
/// get one as the result of a draw command, like [`Cx::add_instances`],
/// or [`View::end_view`].
///
/// Note that an [`Area`] might point to an old element in the draw tree, so use
/// [`Area::is_valid`] to check if it points to the latest version.
///
/// You can use an [`Area`] pointer to write fields, e.g. using [`Area::get_slice_mut`],
/// [`Area::write_user_uniforms`], and so on. You
/// can also use it for checking if an event was fired on a certain part
/// of the draw tree (using [`Event::hits`], [`Cx::key_focus`], etc), and more.
///
/// TODO(JP): this can currently point to a [`View`]/[`CxView`] that isn't
/// actually in the draw tree any more (ie. there the corresponding [`CxView`] is
/// never referenced in the draw tree), or which just doesn't exist at all any
/// more (ie. the [`View`] object has also been removed). There is currently no
/// was of telling if any of this is the case, since there is no "garbage
/// collection" of views. [`CxView`] just sticks around in [`Cx::views`] forever.
